====== Fourier Transformed Overlap Densities ======
The ''FTOD'' is one of the possible input files, providing information on the
orbitals and the eigenenergies of the reference system.
The file provides the Fourier transformed overlap densities $\chi_q^p({\bf G})$ given by
\[
  \chi_q^p({\bf G}) = \int{\rm d}{\bf x}\,
    \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{{\bf G}^2}} {\rm e}^{{\rm i}{\bf G}\cdot{\bf r}}\,
    \psi_p^\ast({\bf x})\psi_q({\bf x}),
\]
such that the Coulomb integrals $V_{sr}^{pq}$ can be decomposed into
$V_{sr}^{pq}=\int\frac{{\rm d}{\bf G}}{(2\pi)^3}\,\chi_s^p({\bf G}){\chi_q^r}^\ast({\bf G})$.
The file is a line based text file of the following structure

There is also a binary version ''[[reference:fourier_transformed_overlap_densities_binary|FTODDUMP]]'' of this file.
===== Header =====
  * The first line is reserved for comments. It is ignored by cc4s
  * The second line provides information on the size of the system. The columns are white-space separated and they specify
    - the number of occupied orbitals $n_{\rm o}$
    - the number of virtual orbitals $n_{\rm v}$
    - the number of plane waves $n_{\rm G}$
    - the number of spins per orbital, 1 or 2
    - the number of ${\bf k}$ points per orbital.
  * The third is line is again reserved for comments usually explaining the structure of the data to follow.
===== Overlap densities =====
The rest of the file contains lines of at least 6 numbers, again in white-space separated columns:
  - The real part of the overlap density, ${\rm Re}\left(\chi_q^p({\bf G})\right)$, if the plane wave index $G$, contained in the third column, is non-zero,\\ the eigenenergy $\varepsilon_p$, otherwise.
  - The imaginary part of the overlap density, ${\rm Im}\left(\chi_q^p({\bf G})\right)$, if the plane wave index in non-zero. It is ignored otherwise.
  - The plane wave index $G$ ranging from 1 to $n_{\rm G}$
  - The orbital index $p$, ranging from 1 to $n_{\rm o}+n_{\rm v}$
  - The orbital index $q$, ranging from 1 to $n_{\rm o}+n_{\rm v}$
  - The spin index, which is currently ignored.
There is no order required by cc4s but it could be beneficial to list all overlap densities before all eigenenergies for future or other implementations.
Overlap densities that are not listed in the file are assumed to be zero.
